          the Carnatic Wars, helping lay the foundations of the British Empire in India. The Rockfort is the most
           prominent landmark of the city.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">The name "Rockfort" comes from frequent military fortification built here, 
      first by the emperors of the Vijayanagara Empire and later by the British Empire during the Carnatic Wars.
      The oldest structure in the fort is a cave temple built by the Pallavas in 580. During the Chola period,
      the nearby town of Woraiyur was their capital, but the Pallavas did not keep control of this strategic 
      city and lost it to the Pandyas. The Cholas reasserted themselves in the 10th century. Trichy continued
      to be in their possession until the decline of the empire, after which it became a Vijayanagara stronghold.
      In the mid 14th century, the region was controlled by the Delhi Sultanate after Malik Kafur's raid on
      South India. They were ousted and the region came under the control of Vijayanagara. During the early
      part of the 16th century, the region came under the control of the Madurai Nayaks, who were the earlier
      governors of Vijayanagara Empire. However, it was under the Nayaks of Madurai that Tiruchirapalli
      prospered in its own right and grew to be the city that it is today. The Madurai Nayaks constructed 
      the Rock Fort Temple Lake along with major walls as foundations, establishing the town as a trading
      city and later, their capital. During ruling period of Madurai Nayak Queen Meenatchi, The fort 
      palace was occupied by the invader Chanda Sahib, as he ruled in conjunction with the alliance 
      with the Kingdom of France. He lost this command when his uncle, the Nawab of the Carnatic 
      along with the British, seized the fort after the Carnatic wars. This enabled the British to gain 
      a foothold in Tamil Nadu and later all of South India. In modern times, the fort is maintained 
      and administered by the Chennai Circle of the Archaeological Survey of India. The fort is one of the 
      prominent tourist destinations in Tamil Nadu.
