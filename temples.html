    <br><br>

    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Kapaleeshwarar temple was constructed in the 7th century CE by the Pallavas. 
        The Kapaleeshwarar Temple was first constructed where Santhome Church is presently located in Chennai. 
        This temple was destroyed by the Portuguese and the present temple was constructed in the 16th century by 
        the Vijayanagar Kings.
        </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">The Kapaleeshwarar Temple is an image of the Dravidian style of design with huge 
        gopuram (tower). The temple has two passageways. Its fragmentary engravings exist since 1250 AD, however, 
        the design and structure of the temple is progressively related to the culture sixteenth century, when 
        Vijay Nagar lords rebuilt it. According to the custom, Goddess Karpagambal is offered a wreath made of 
        gold coins named kaasu maala on the custom of Friday worship. There are separate sannadhis for few Gods 
        like Vinayagar, Annamalaiyar, Murugar and Saneeswara. The prominent component of this structure is the 
        37-meter tall gopuram, overpowering the road on which the temple sits. As you enter the temple you can see 
        a sculpture of a sacred saint known as Gnanasambandar.
    </p>    
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">There is a religious story behind the name 'Mylapore' as indicated by the Puranas, 
        the celestial Shakti offered her dedication to Lord Shiva in the form of a peacock. In Tamil, the peacock is 
        called as 'mayil'. Consequently, the territory encompassing the temple was created with the name Mylai. 
        The story behind the temple is fascinating. Once, Brahma did not pay his regards to Shiva and Parvathi in 
        Mount Kailash when he saw them. This infuriated Lord Shiva, and he cut of one of Brahmas head to teach him 
        a lesson. Brahma apologized for his behaviour and came to Mylapore. He introduced a Shiva lingam and started 
        doing poojas that satisfied Lord Shiva. The head Shiva took away from Brahma was Kapalam and as Brahma 
        introduced a Shiva lingam as a penance for his transgressions, the Shiva Lingam came to be known as 
        Kapaleeswarar.

    <br><br>
     
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Brihadeeshwara Temple (Peruvudaiyar Kovil) is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva 
        located in Thanjavur in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is also known as Periya Kovil, RajaRajeswara 
        Temple and Rajarajesvaram. It is one of the largest temples in India and is an example of Dravidian 
        architecture during the Chola period. Built by emperor Raja Raja Chola I and completed in 1010 AD, 
        the temple turned 1000 years old in 2010. The temple is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known 
        as the “Great Living Chola Temples”, with the other two being the Brihadeeswarar Temple, Gangaikonda 
        Cholapuram and Airavatesvara temple. The temple stands amidst fortified walls that were probably added in the 16th century. The vimanam 
        (temple tower) is 216 ft (66 m) high and is the tallest in the world. The Kumbam (the apex or the 
        bulbous structure on the top) of the temple is carved out of a single rock and weighs around 80 tons. There 
        is a big statue of Nandi (sacred bull), carved out of a single rock measuring about 16 ft (4.9 m) long and 
        13 ft (4.0 m) high at the entrance. The entire temple structure is made out of granite, the nearest sources 
        of which are about 60 km to the west of temple. The temple is one of the most visited tourist attractions 
        in Tamil Nadu.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Arulmozhivarman, a Tamil emperor who was popular as Rajaraja Chola I laid out 
        foundations of Brihadeeswarar Temple during 1002 CE. It was first among other great building projects by 
        Tamil Chola. A symmetrical and axial geometry rules layout of this temple. Temples from same period and two 
        following centuries are expressions of Tamils Chola power, artistic expertise and wealth. Emergence of 
        these types of features, such as multifaceted columns along with projecting signals of square capitals 
        signifies arrival of Chola style, which was new at that time. It is one architectural exemplar, which 
        showcases true form of Dravida kind of architecture in temples and is a representative of ideology of 
        Chola Empire and Southern India’s Tamil civilization. Brihadeeswarar Temple “testifies to Chola’s brilliant 
        achievements in architecture, painting, bronze casting and sculpture.”

    <br><br>
     
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Meenakshi Amman Temple, also known as Minakshi-Sundareshwara Temple, is one of the 
        oldest and most important temples in India. Located in the city of Madurai, the temple has a great 
        mythological and historical significance. It is believed that Lord Shiva assumed the form of Sundareswarar 
        (the handsome one) and married Parvati (Meenakshi) at the site where the temple is currently located. 
        Renowned for its astonishing architecture, Meenakshi Temple was nominated as one of the wonders of the world,
         but couldn’t make it into the list of ‘Seven Wonders of the World’. However, the temple is definitely one of 
         the ‘Wonders of India’. It is also one of the main attractions of South India with thousands of devotees 
         thronging it every day. During the ‘Tirukalyanam Festival,’ which takes place over a period of 10 days, 
         the temple attracts more than a million devotees. Despite many people visiting it every day, the temple 
         is well-maintained and was named the ‘Best Swachh Iconic Place’ (cleanest iconic place) in India.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">The history of Meenakshi Temple dates back to the 1st century C.E with 
        scholars claiming it to be as old as the city itself. It is said that Kulashekarar Pandyan, a king who 
        ruled over the Pandyan dynasty, built the temple as per the instructions given in his dream by Lord Shiva.
         A few religious texts that belong to the 1st to 4th century C.E talk about the temple and describe it as 
         the central structure of the city. Texts dating back to the early 6th century, describe the temple as a 
         place where scholars met to discuss important topics. The temple as it stands today, however, was rebuilt 
         throughout the 16th century as it was destroyed by the Muslim invaders. During the 14th century C.E, 
         Malik Kafur, a commander of Delhi Sultanate, led his army into most parts of southern India and looted 
         many temples including the famed Meenakshi Temple. Valuables, such as gold, silver and precious gems were 
         taken to Delhi. Since temples in those days had abundance of valuables, most of the temples were destroyed 
         and were left in ruins. When the Vijayanagar Empire took over Madurai after defeating the Muslim Sultanate,
          the temple was rebuilt and reopened. The temple was further expanded during the late 16th century and
           early 17th century by Vishwanatha Nayakar, a king of the Nayaka dynasty. According to researchers, while 
           rebuilding the temple, the rulers of Nayaka dynasty followed the architectural style of <q>Shastras</q>
            <q> Shastras</q> are a set of architectural laws found in the ancient texts.

        of Durga Devi, The Lord Shiva wanted to marry Durga Devi. The devine sage Narada wanted to stop the 
        marriage in order to kill Banasura by the Durgadevi. In order to prevent the marriage between DurgaDevi

         such as coconuts without eyes, mangoes without seeds, betel leaves without veins. Mighty Lord Shiva 
         managed to get all those rare things and became ready for the marriage at mid-night. Lord Shiva started
